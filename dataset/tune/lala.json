In moderation, it can, by inspiring our imagination and sparking a passion for life, open up our experience and expand our sense of our own potential. It can even deepen our love for family, friends, and partners. By far, the most powerful predictor of success in romantic relationships is our tendency to view our partners as better than they actually are.

Others look at what happens when we try to understand other people, usually called \u201csocial cognition\u201d or \u201ctheory of mind\u201d but sometimes called \u201ccognitive empathy.\u201d Others look at quite specific instantiations of empathy (such as what happens when you watch someone\u2019s face contort in disgust), and still others study what goes on in the brain when a person decides to do something nice for another person, which is sometimes called \u201cprosocial concern\u201d but which one normally thinks of as niceness or kindness.

Both are social, mainly geared toward other people, distinguishing them from emotions such as fear and disgust, which are often elicited by inanimate beings and experiences. Most of all, they are both moral, in that they connect to judgments of right and wrong. Often empathy can motivate kind behavior toward others (I should help this person); and often anger can motivate other actions, such as punishment (I should hurt this person). And they can be related to one another. We\u2019ve seen that empathy can lead to anger; the empathy one feels toward an individual can fuel anger toward those who are cruel to that individual.",
