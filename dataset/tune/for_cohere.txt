question: What is the most powerful predictor of success in romantic relationships?
text: Narcissism, it turns out, exists on a spectrum. In moderation, it can, by inspiring our imagination and sparking a passion for life, open up our experience and expand our sense of our own potential. It can even deepen our love for family, friends, and partners. By far, the most powerful predictor of success in romantic relationships is our tendency to view our partners as better than they actually are. I call this “feeling special by association.”

question: What are some emotions that narcissists bury?
text: Narcissists bury normal emotions like fear, sadness, loneliness, and shame because they’re afraid they’ll be rejected for having them; the greater their fear, the more they shield themselves with the belief that they’re special. Unhealthy narcissism isn’t an easy habit to break, but people can become healthier by learning to accept and share the emotions they usually hide. And their loved ones can help them shift to the healthy center of the spectrum by opening up in the exact same way.

question: How does one know if they are at 0 or 10?
text: Life at the far right is just as bleak. While people at 0 assiduously avoid the spotlight, those at the far right either scramble for it or silently long for it. In their minds, they cease to exist if people aren’t acknowledging their importance. They’re addicted to attention, and like most addicts, they’d do anything to get their high, so even authentic love takes a backseat. At 10 our humanity collapses under the weight of empty posturing and arrogance. Think of Bernie Madoff, who swindled hundreds of millions of dollars from his clients and who, when caught, scoffed at the “incompetence” of the investigators for not asking the right questions. Even as he faced life in prison, he still managed to feel superior.

question: How did the psychologists Robert Hill and Gregory Yousey, of Appalachian State University, study the narcissistic tendencies of politicians?
text: Psychologists Robert Hill and Gregory Yousey, of Appalachian State University, also studied the narcissistic tendencies of politicians (excluding presidents), comparing them with librarians, university professors, and clergy. Politicians again ranked higher in narcissism than any other group. Clergy and professors were deemed the healthiest, with librarians the least narcissistic. Unlike the politicians, none of the other professionals scored high enough to earn the label narcissist, though librarians certainly scored low enough to flirt with echoism.

question: How did Gary react to his parents urging him to seek help?
text: Gary’s parents had been on the phone with him nightly for a week, urging him to seek help. “I’m at my wit’s end,” his mother had said, in a tearful message left on my voice mail. Gary shrugged it off. “She gets that way.” The dean had been a staunch defender, despite Gary’s blithe attitude about his imminent expulsion. He’d known Gary since he was a toddler and clearly thought of him as a son. The whole situation had obviously been taking its toll—the dean sounded exhausted in his messages. But Gary seemed oblivious to just how anxious he’d made everyone around him, especially those who cared about him. “The dean’s as big a worrier as my mom.”

question: What are some signs of a higher narcissistic drive?
text: Narcissism, too, is naturally stronger in some people than others. Signs of a higher narcissistic drive emerge as early as age three—a relentless craving for attention, an outright allergy to rules. Narcissism may also be heightened by lack of another innate tendency that shows up early: empathy, or compassion for others. Much less is known about the basic temperament of echoists, but preliminary findings from the Narcissism Spectrum Scale (NSS) suggest that people on the far left might be born with a more fragile nature—prone, perhaps, to guilt and shame and fear—and therefore more likely to keep a low profile in any environment.

question: What are two ways that children can cope with a narcissistic parent?
text: Jay, naturally rambunctious, and Carol, timid from birth, grew up in a home ruled by a highly narcissistic father, who flew into a rage whenever his nightly routine—reading the paper and throwing back Jim Beam—was disturbed. Carol learned to take the path of least resistance, tiptoeing around her dad in the hopes that he’d stay calm, while boisterous Jay found the only way he could get noticed was, like his father, to shout and dominate others before they could dominate him. Both siblings displayed unhealthy levels of narcissism, but had learned different coping mechanisms as children that led them to become mentally unstable adults.

question: What did Jean's father warn her about?
text: In fact, anything that smacked of self-importance seemed to earn silence or subtle disapproval from her family. Her father, Irish American and a devout Catholic, was a stern judge and had often warned her that most people commit crimes out of pride. At night, before bed, he sat puffing on his pipe and rattling off sayings, like “Never get a big head—it’s a sure path to trouble.” The rules left her feeling hemmed in, quietly ashamed of her own aspirations. Jean couldn’t recall a single moment when she felt comfortable sharing her accomplishments.

question: What is the controversial diagnosis called?
text: At this level, people become ill, earning them the controversial diagnosis, narcissistic personality disorder. You probably won’t meet many people with NPD in your life. But it’s important to know what the disorder looks like. Like all personality disorders, it’s very difficult to treat. People with NPD need professional help to shift down the spectrum at all—and if they refuse that help, there’s very little chance of change. You should think of NPD exactly the way you would any full-blown addiction; recovery’s a tough road, but it’s impossible when the person denies the problem and refuses help.

question: How does confrontation make things worse when dealing with an extreme narcissist?
text: Confrontation doesn’t seem to improve these situations either. Criticizing an extreme narcissist’s manner (“Stop interrupting people!”) or pointing out their mistakes (“That slide’s completely wrong”) usually makes things worse. They can’t absorb honest, accurate feedback; instead they become more angry and aggressive, and the already mistreated worker is bound to face a verbal lashing. Besides, where power differences exist, as they did between Jane and Drew, such frank feedback might not even be possible. Few people feel comfortable correcting their boss, let alone an insufferably conceited supervisor or CEO.

question: How do we explain away bad behavior from a colleague?
text: Alternatively, when we do recognize we’re being slammed, we have a tendency to blame ourselves, just as we would in an unhappy love relationship. I’m being overly sensitive. I just need to work harder. I really screwed up. We explain away our colleague’s bad behavior for the same reason we dismiss the cruelty of a parent or lover. We need them, we need the job—to eat, to pay the rent or mortgage, to provide for our families. We can’t simply quit, any more than a child can just waltz out the door of an unhappy home.

question: Why can't we quit our jobs?
text: Alternatively, when we do recognize we’re being slammed, we have a tendency to blame ourselves, just as we would in an unhappy love relationship. I’m being overly sensitive. I just need to work harder. I really screwed up. We explain away our colleague’s bad behavior for the same reason we dismiss the cruelty of a parent or lover. We need them, we need the job—to eat, to pay the rent or mortgage, to provide for our families. We can’t simply quit, any more than a child can just waltz out the door of an unhappy home.

question: How do you give legitimate praise?
text: Does this turn you into a sycophant? No. There’s a difference between sucking up and giving legitimate praise. You’re not making blanket endorsements of their conduct, only singling out specific instances of good behavior. Constant flattery is a no-no; it only feeds unhealthy narcissism. If you have nothing nice to say to a highly narcissistic boss, don’t say anything at all. But if you see an action you like, make sure you point it out, clearly and sincerely (or you may never see it again).

question: How can we tell if someone is a narcissist?
text: Ironically, Napoleon, the self-proclaimed emperor who ruthlessly carved a realm across Europe, seemed to understand this, even if he failed to apply it to his own actions. We can point to many examples of passionate people throughout history who visited great evil upon the world: Hitler, Stalin, Saddam Hussein. Narcissists in our everyday lives, especially the gregarious ones, often have plenty of passion because they give free rein to their needs and desires. That’s why we often find so many of them attractive. Nothing stands in the way of what they want, whether they’re seducing a date, tackling risky business ventures, or defeating a rival sports team. But their passion, in the end, is neither genuine nor fulfilling because even our deepest desires become tenuous if we lose connection to the people we love. British psychoanalyst and child therapist Donald Winnicott poignantly captured the truth of this in his studies of children lost in creative play.

question: What are Lisa's favorite hobbies?
text: Lisa, the outgoing activist we met in Chapter 3, frequently enjoyed her favorite hobbies, bike racing and wine tasting, by herself, but she was just as content to have her husband, Doug, join her when he could. Rather than threatening her plans and dreams, his presence gave her more energy to bring them to fruition and she took great delight in sharing them. “I want us to build an amazing life together,” she observed during one of our meetings. At the same time, Lisa derived almost as much pleasure from supporting Doug’s interests. “I love helping him plan his weekends hiking in the mountains by himself. That’s his passion. And he always comes back looking happy!”

question: How did the man feel after meeting Jean?
text: “Something changed that day,” he replied. “Something in me was different. I felt like I mattered to someone, that I could relax a little.” This was big for him; in the past, he’d chased after one special high after another, never feeling like he’d won enough people over with his charm or good looks. “My own mother only ever used me to show off,” he said, sadly, “telling people how handsome I was or how smart, but I can’t recall a time I felt like she really saw me for who I was. Not like Jean has. I found myself telling her things I’ve never told anyone before.”

question: What is the relationship between the feeling of meaninglessness and neurosis?
text: In fact, the drug scene is one aspect of a more general mass phenomenon, namely the feeling of meaninglessness resulting from a frustration of our existential needs which in turn has become a universal phenomenon in our industrial societies. Today it is not only logotherapists who claim that the feeling of meaninglessness plays an ever increasing role in the etiology of neurosis. As Irvin D. Yalom of Stanford University states in Existential Psychotherapy: “Of forty consecutive patients applying for therapy at a psychiatric outpatient clinic … twelve (30 percent) had some major problem involving meaning (as adjudged from self-ratings, therapists, or independent judges).”1 Thousands of miles east of Palo Alto, the situation differs only by 1 percent; the most recent pertinent statistics indicate that in Vienna, 29 percent of the population complain that meaning is missing from their lives.

question: How does logotherapy teach that there are three main avenues on which one arrives at meaning in life?
text: As logotherapy teaches, there are three main avenues on which one arrives at meaning in life. The first is by creating a work or by doing a deed. The second is by experiencing something or encountering someone; in other words, meaning can be found not only in work but also in love. Edith Weisskopf-Joelson observed in this context that the logotherapeutic “notion that experiencing can be as valuable as achieving is therapeutic because it compensates for our one-sided emphasis on the external world of achievement at the expense of the internal world of experience.”6

But they have more than that. Instead of possibilities in the future, they have realities in the past—the potentialities they have actualized, the meanings they have fulfilled, the values they have realized—and nothing and nobody can ever remove these assets from the past.

text: Charities do this sort of thing all the time, using pictures and stories to get you to empathize with suffering people. I once told the leader of a charitable organization that I was writing a book encouraging people to be less empathic, and she got angry, telling me that if she couldn’t stir up empathy, her group would get less money, and then some of the children she had spent so much time with would die.

question: What is empathy?
text: It turns out, though, that this the-whole-brain-does-it conclusion arises because neuroscientists—along with psychologists and philosophers—are often sloppy in their use of the term empathy. Some investigators look at what I see as empathy proper—what happens in the brain when someone feels the same thing they believe another person is feeling. Others look at what happens when we try to understand other people, usually called “social cognition” or “theory of mind” but sometimes called “cognitive empathy.” Others look at quite specific instantiations of empathy (such as what happens when you watch someone’s face contort in disgust), and still others study what goes on in the brain when a person decides to do something nice for another person, which is sometimes called “prosocial concern” but which one normally thinks of as niceness or kindness. Once you start pulling these different phenomena apart, which I’ll do below, things get more interesting, and you see how these different capacities relate to one another.

question: What is the anterior insula?
text: Other research looks at disgust. A part of the brain known as the anterior insula (which is also involved in pain, among other things) lights up both when you feel disgusted and when you look at someone else being disgusted. There is something intuitive about this finding. Many years ago there was a particularly vivid viral video, called “2 girls, 1 cup,” which I’m not going to describe here, except to say that it really was extremely disgusting. (If you’re tempted to look for it online, consider this a trigger warning.) The online magazine Slate had the interesting idea of showing a video of people watching the video, so you can see their faces contort as they respond. The face video is hilarious, but also disgusting—watching the disgust of others triggers a hint of disgust in yourself.

question: What is the relationship between empathy and envy?
text: Again, Adam Smith was here first, observing that the empathy we feel toward others is sensitive to all sorts of considerations. He notes that you’re not going to feel an empathically positive response toward someone who has a sudden and great success—envy blocks this sort of pleasure. And you’re not going to feel the pain of those whose problems you see as their own fault or that you view as insignificant. It’s hard to feel empathy for whiners. Smith gives the example of a man who is really annoyed because while he was telling a story to his brother, his brother was humming. You’re not going to empathize with that, Smith points out. You’re more likely to find it funny.

question: How can we explain the fact that people often cross the street to avoid encountering suffering people who are begging for money?
text: She was definitely suffering from seeing the treatment of the prisoners, but it didn’t motivate her to want to save them: She would be satisfied if she could have this suffering continue out of her sight. This feeling shouldn’t be that alien to many of us. People often cross the street to avoid encountering suffering people who are begging for money. It’s not that they don’t care (if they didn’t care, they would just walk by), it’s that they are bothered by the suffering and would rather not encounter it. Usually, escape is even easier.

In what follows, I’m going to use phrases like left/liberal/progressive and right/conservative in the usual way that nonacademic Americans and Europeans do.

That is, when people associate liberals with empathy, they think of liberals in the usual way that they are talked about in everyday discourse—as those who want greater legal protection for sexual and ethnic minorities, who worry about the proliferation of guns, who favor legal access to abortion, who support diversity programs in universities, who support universal health care, and so on.

question: What is the relationship between empathy and political orientation?
text: Finally, if it turns out that being liberal is more attractive to empathic people, this could help make sense of the fact that women are statistically more likely to be liberal than men, since women tend to be somewhat more empathic than men.

question: What is the relationship between gender and political orientation?
text: Finally, if it turns out that being liberal is more attractive to empathic people, this could help make sense of the fact that women are statistically more likely to be liberal than men, since women tend to be somewhat more empathic than men. The authors of one study that looked at empathy, gender, and political orientation conclude that if males were as empathic as females, the gender gap in politics would almost entirely disappear.

question: What neurological difference was explored in a series of fMRI studies?
text: The neurological difference between the two was explored in a series of fMRI studies that used Ricard as a subject. While in the scanner, Ricard was asked to engage in various types of compassion meditation directed toward people who are suffering. To the surprise of the investigators, his meditative states did not activate those parts of the brain associated with empathic distress—those that are normally activated by nonmeditators when they think about others’ pain. And Ricard’s experience was pleasant and invigorating. Once out of the magnet, Ricard described it as: “a warm positive state associated with a strong prosocial motivation.”

question: What is the difference between emotional empathy and compassion?
text: As I’ve mentioned a few times by now, it’s hard to know what to make of these claims, given all of the everyday instances in which we care for people and help them without engaging in emotional empathy. I can worry about a child who is afraid of a thunderstorm and pick her up and comfort her without experiencing her fear in the slightest. I can be concerned about starving people and try to support them without having any vicarious experience of starving. And now the research we just discussed supports an even stronger conclusion. Not only can compassion and kindness exist independently of empathy, they are sometimes opposed. Sometimes we are better people if we suppress our empathic feelings.

question: How do good therapists manage to shut down their empathic responses?
text: Actually, therapy would be an impossible job for many of us because of our inability to shut down our empathic responses. But good therapists are unusual in this regard. A friend of mine is a clinical psychologist with a busy schedule, working for several hours at a stretch, with one client leaving and the next coming in. This would kill me. I find it exhausting to spend even a short time with someone who is depressed or anxious. But my friend finds it exhilarating. She is engaged by her clients’ problems, interested in the challenges that arise, and excited by the possibility of improving their lives.

question: How can a doctor or therapist maintain an emotional distance while still showing concern and understanding?
text: I agree with a lot of this. It makes sense that concern and understanding are important. But I think it’s possible to have concern and understanding while maintaining an emotional distance, without the doctor or therapist having to “inhabit” the patient’s feelings. I think it’s actually better when this distance is present, both for the patient and for the doctor.

question: How can envy be avoided?
text: Your happy friend can best make you happy when envy doesn’t apply. This can occur when the boundaries of the self somehow expand to include the happy person, so that his accomplishment feels like my accomplishment. This most easily happens with the accomplishments of one’s children, perhaps, but it can also apply when we see people as bringing credit to our communities. When Daniel Kahneman won a Nobel Prize, I was delighted because he is a fellow psychologist; when Robert Schiller won one, I was delighted because he is from Yale and, more important, lives on my street, eight houses down from my own. So, in some possibly pathetic way, their great accomplishments became my own.

question: What is the difference between wanting someone to suffer and wanting them to feel the same pain as the victim?
text: There is another, very different reason to want others to feel your pain.

question: How do you think people can decide between loyalty to friends and family and being fair to others?
text: It would certainly be simpler if we could keep these issues separate—if there were two moralities, one for home and one for the outside world. But any sharp distinction quickly collapses because there is only so much to go around. If I have a hundred dollars and decide to give it to one of my sons so he can buy books for school, that’s a hundred dollars that’s not going to help children who are going blind in Africa. If I get to decide who to hire as a research assistant in my lab and my friend asks me to hire his daughter, my loyalty to my friend will clash with any fair and neutral process for choosing the candidates.

question: What is the difference between caring for others and feeling empathy?
text: In my last book, Just Babies, I cited all this as evidence for early empathy. But I’m no longer sure that’s true. All these anecdotes and experimental findings can be readily accounted for in terms of caring for others without any sort of empathic feeling. William’s sadness, for instance, might reflect the fact that he was sad that his nurse seemed to be suffering—but this doesn’t entail that he was feeling her pain in any real empathic sense.

question: What is the opposite view of violence?
text: But there is another, opposite, view, popular among economists and evolutionary theorists. This is that violence is an essential part of life, an often rational solution to certain problems. Cancer is an aberration, an illness, something that could be cleanly excised from the world: If it were eradicated tomorrow, the rest of human life would remain happily intact. But violence is part of human nature, shared with other animals, evolved for punishment, defense, and predation. And unless we are transformed into angels, violence and the threat of violence are needed to rein in our worst instincts. You can have a world without cancer, but there will never be a world without violence. Since the recipients of violence are rarely pleased with the violence directed toward them, then, in the eyes of some, at least, there will never be a world without evil.

They are wrong to see themselves as innocents, but we are wrong as well to see them as different creatures from the rest of us.

text: Morality is motivating. I read a story earlier today, from many years ago, about a man who went with his wife and children to the beach in Dubai. His older daughter, a twenty-year-old, went out for a swim and started to struggle in the water and scream for help. The father was strong enough to keep two lifeguards from rescuing her. According to a police officer, “He told them that he prefers his daughter being dead than being touched by a strange man.” She drowned.

question: How is empathy related to anger?
text: As we think about empathy, it’s useful to compare it to anger. They have a lot in common: Both are universal responses that emerge in childhood. Both are social, mainly geared toward other people, distinguishing them from emotions such as fear and disgust, which are often elicited by inanimate beings and experiences. Most of all, they are both moral, in that they connect to judgments of right and wrong. Often empathy can motivate kind behavior toward others (I should help this person); and often anger can motivate other actions, such as punishment (I should hurt this person). And they can be related to one another. We’ve seen that empathy can lead to anger; the empathy one feels toward an individual can fuel anger toward those who are cruel to that individual.

text: As we think about empathy, it’s useful to compare it to anger. They have a lot in common: Both are universal responses that emerge in childhood. Both are social, mainly geared toward other people, distinguishing them from emotions such as fear and disgust, which are often elicited by inanimate beings and experiences. Most of all, they are both moral, in that they connect to judgments of right and wrong. Often empathy can motivate kind behavior toward others (I should help this person); and often anger can motivate other actions, such as punishment (I should hurt this person). And they can be related to one another. We’ve seen that empathy can lead to anger; the empathy one feels toward an individual can fuel anger toward those who are cruel to that individual.

question: What are valid points about anger?
text: These are valid points. If I could genetically engineer the brain of my newborn baby, I wouldn’t leave anger entirely out. Along the lines of Flanagan, the emotional force of anger will help protect the child and those close to the child, particularly in a world where everyone else has anger. And along the lines of Prinz, anger can be a prod to moral behavior. Many moral heroes have been people who let themselves get angry at situations that others were indifferent about, and who used anger as a motivating force for themselves and others.

question: What is the message of emotional loneliness?
text: This kind of emotional pain and loneliness is actually a healthy message. The anxiety felt by David and Rhonda was letting them know that they were in dire need of emotional contact. But because their parents didn’t notice how they felt, all they could do was keep their feelings inside. Fortunately, once you start listening to your emotions instead of shutting them down, they will guide you toward an authentic connection with others. Knowing the cause of your emotional loneliness is the first step toward finding more fulfilling relationships.

question: What is an example of a situation where this would be a good joke in a relationship?
text: I honestly cannot think of a single situation where this would be a good joke in a relationship. It’s too deflating and demeaning. But as Sophie recognized later, her mother and Jerry had a lot in common in their insensitivity to people’s feelings. Every time Sophie tried to tell them how she felt, she ended up feeling invalidated.

question: What is the most essential ingredient of human relationships?
text: Meaghan felt embarrassed and guilty because her emotional needs were outweighing her vows and commitments. But as I pointed out to her, vows and promises aren’t the fuel relationships run on. Relationship are sustained by the pleasure of emotional intimacy, the feeling that someone is interested in taking the time to really listen and understand your experience. If you don’t have that, your relationship won’t thrive. Mutual emotional responsiveness is the single most essential ingredient of human relationships.

question: What is an emotionally immature person?
text: Emotionally immature people assess situations in a subjective way, not objectively. They don’t do much dispassionate analysis. When they interpret situations, how they are feeling is more important than what is actually happening. What is true doesn’t matter nearly as much as what feels true (Bowen 1978). Trying to get a subjectively oriented person to be objective about anything is an exercise in futility. Facts, logic, history—all fall on deaf ears where the emotionally immature are concerned.

question: How can emotionally immature people be quite canny when it comes to reading other people's intentions and feelings?
text: This casts light on a curious fact about emotionally immature people. In spite of not resonating empathically, they are often quite canny when it comes to reading other people’s intentions and feelings. However, they don’t use their understanding of people to foster emotional intimacy. Instead, their empathy operates at an instinctual or superficially sentimental level. You may feel sized up, but not felt for.

question: How does the author explain why caretaking during illness would allow a parent the justification to indulge a child with attention and affection?
text: This makes sense, because caretaking during illness would allow a parent the justification to “indulge” a child with attention and affection. It stands to reason that affectionate caretaking felt safe to these parents when done for the purpose of restoring the child’s physical health.

question: How do emotional parents affect their children?
text: Emotional parents are the most infantile of the four types. They give the impression that they need to be watched over and handled carefully. It doesn’t take much to upset them, and then everyone in the family scrambles to soothe them. When emotional parents disintegrate, they take their children with them into their personal meltdown. Their children experience their despair, rage, or hatred in all its intensity. It’s no wonder that everyone in the family feels like they’re walking on eggshells. These parents’ emotional instability is the most predictable thing about them.

question: How did Christine's father control her?
text: Christine was an attorney with a very domineering father, Joseph, who constantly pushed her to be a success. Early in our work together, she described her childhood like this: “My father controlled me. He couldn’t stand anyone having a different opinion; it was absolutely intolerable to him. I was so afraid of making the wrong choice that I made a lot of decisions based on fear. It was as if my father completely owned me. Even in college I had to be home by eleven, which was extremely embarrassing, but I wouldn’t have dreamed of challenging him.”

question: How do children of passive parents often behave as adults?
text: Children who adored a passive parent can become adults who make excuses for other people’s abandoning behavior. As children, they believed nothing could be done about their childhood situation and that the passive parent was truly helpless. They’re often taken aback by the idea that their wonderful, nice parent actually had a responsibility to stand up for them when they couldn’t protect themselves as children. They’ve never considered that parents have a duty to put their children’s emotional welfare at least on an even footing with their own interests.

question: How do emotionally immature people react when they feel insecure?
text: Most emotionally immature people tend to be externalizers who don’t know how to calm themselves through genuine emotional engagement. When they feel insecure, instead of seeking comfort from other people they tend to feel threatened and launch into fight, flight, or freeze behaviors. They react to anxious moments in relationships with rigid, defensive behaviors that alienate other people, rather than bringing them closer. Anger, blame, criticism, and domination are all signs of poorly functioning skills in seeking comfort. Externalizers simply don’t know how to reach out for soothing.

Reflecting on her failing marriage, one woman put it this way: “I thought I could be enough for both of us.” Internalizers are accustomed to supplying most of the empathy and doing more than their fair share in trying to get along, and for a long time they may not notice that they’re getting worn out while the other person isn’t changing at all.

You might try a phrase like “I don’t like it when this person ___________ ,” describing their behavior. When you hit upon your true feelings, you’ll feel a release of tension or sense of relief in your body. Don’t let guilt inhibit you. You’re speaking only to yourself, for the purpose of self-discovery. No one can hear you, and it’s completely safe.

question: What is the definition of emotional enmeshment?
text: As you can see, staying observational isn’t passive; it’s a very active process. It’s also the royal road out of emotional enmeshment. As you practice observing, you’ll become stronger and more confident in your ability to see what’s really going on, especially now that you have more of an understanding of emotional immaturity. You no longer have to be the upset, helpless child, devastated by potshots from your parent. Your clear mind and observational attitude will keep you strong no matter what the other person does.

question: How can you center yourself when you feel guilty?
text: Response: Center yourself by focusing on your breath as it flows in and out. Feeling guilty isn’t an emergency. Observe what’s going on and silently narrate it to yourself in specific words. Mentally describing what’s happening helps move you from your brain’s emotional centers to its more objective, logical areas. Another strategy is to count. How many seconds did your parent go on that time? You might look at a clock and decide how much longer you’re willing to listen. When that time is up, interrupt politely and say you have to leave or get off the phone soon. Say you have something to do, then disengage. You can also talk kindly to yourself: There’s no reason to feel guilt. They’re trying to push their feelings on me. I haven’t done anything wrong. I have a right to an opinion. Try reminding yourself that your parent is attempting a diversion, and that it’s just like dealing with an upset toddler: the unpleasantness will be over sooner if you stay calm and focused on your desired outcome instead of getting into the fray.

Try reminding yourself that your parent is attempting a diversion, and that it’s just like dealing with an upset toddler: the unpleasantness will be over sooner if you stay calm and focused on your desired outcome instead of getting into the fray.

question: What is the name of the chapter?
text: On Betty’s birthday, Annie called and left a couple of messages, but she didn’t invite her mother over. Annie felt good about doing as much as was emotionally possible for her to do. She didn’t make it her problem that Betty didn’t call back. When Annie finally reached Betty on the phone a few days later, her mother answered tersely, in a cold, reserved tone. Annie played it straight and said, “I’m surprised I didn’t hear from you. Did you get my messages?” When Betty answered coolly in the affirmative, not thanking her and not showing any warmth, Annie decided to end the conversation and said, “We’ll have to catch up sometime, Mom. Why don’t you call me? We’ll schedule a get-together.”

question: How do you know if you are emotionally phobic?
text: If you allow yourself to slip back into those old childhood hopes, your parents’ increased openness is likely to evaporate instantly because you’ll no longer feel safe to them. Remember, your parents are probably emotionally phobic and unable to handle genuine intimacy. If you become more open, they’ll react by pulling back, trying to get you off balance and back under their control. This is the only way such people know to protect themselves from the vulnerability of too much closeness.
