    "text": "Emotional loneliness comes from not having enough emotional\nintimacy with other people. It can start in childhood, due to\nfeeling emotionally unseen by self-preoccupied parents, or it can\narise in adulthood when an emotional connection is lost. If it\u2019s been a\nlifelong feeling, it points to the likelihood of not being sufficiently emotionally responded to as a child.\nGrowing up in a family with emotionally immature parents is a lonely\nexperience. These parents may look and act perfectly normal, caring for\ntheir child\u2019s physical health and providing meals and safety. However, if\nthey don\u2019t make a solid emotional connection with their child, the child\nwill have a gaping hole where true security might have been.\nThe loneliness of feeling unseen by others is as fundamental a pain as\nphysical injury, but it doesn\u2019t show on the outside. Emotional loneliness is\na vague and private experience, not easy to see or describe. You might call\nit a feeling of emptiness or being alone in the world. Some people have\ncalled this feeling existential loneliness, but there\u2019s nothing existential\nabout it. If you feel it, it came from your family.\nChildren have no way of identifying a lack of emotional intimacy in\ntheir relationship with a parent. It isn\u2019t a concept they have. And it\u2019s even \nless likely that they can understand that their parents are emotionally\nimmature. All they have is a gut feeling of emptiness, which is how a child\nexperiences loneliness. With a mature parent, the child\u2019s remedy for loneliness is simply to go to the parent for affectionate connection. But if your\nparent was scared of deep feelings, you might have been left with an uneasy\nsense of shame for needing comforting.\nWhen the children of emotionally immature parents grow up, the\ncore emptiness remains, even if they have a superficially normal adult life.\nTheir loneliness can continue into adulthood if they unwittingly choose\nrelationships that can\u2019t give them enough emotional connection. They\nmay go to school, work, marry, and raise children, but all the while they\u2019ll\nstill be haunted by that core sense of emotional isolation. In this chapter,\nwe\u2019ll look at people\u2019s experience of emotional loneliness, along with how\nself-awareness helped them understand what they were missing and how\nto change.",

    "text": "Emotional intimacy involves knowing that you have someone you can tell\nanything to, someone to go to with all your feelings, about anything and\neverything. You feel completely safe opening up to the other person,\nwhether in the form of words, through an exchange of looks, or by just\nbeing together quietly in a state of connection. Emotional intimacy is profoundly fulfilling, creating a sense of being seen for who you really are. It\ncan only exist when the other person seeks to know you, not judge you.\nAs children, the basis for our security is emotional connection with\nour caretakers. Emotionally engaged parents make children feel that they\nalways have someone to go to. This kind of security requires genuine emotional interactions with parents. Parents who are emotionally mature\nengage in this level of emotional connection almost all the time. They\u2019ve\ndeveloped enough self-awareness to be comfortable with their own feelings, as well as those of other people.\nMore importantly, they\u2019re emotionally attuned to their children,\nnoticing their children\u2019s moods and welcoming their feelings with interest.\nA child feels safe connecting with such a parent, whether seeking comfort\nor sharing enthusiasm. Mature parents make their children feel that they\nenjoy engaging with them and that it\u2019s fine to talk about emotional issues.\nThese parents have a lively, balanced emotional life and are usually consistent in their attentiveness and interest toward their children. They are\nemotionally dependable.",

In\naddition, they discount feelings, and they fear emotional intimacy. They\u2019re\nuncomfortable with their own emotional needs and therefore have no idea\nhow to offer support at an emotional level. Such parents may even become\nnervous and angry if their children get upset, punishing them instead of\ncomforting them. These reactions shut down children\u2019s instinctive urge to\nreach out, closing the door to emotional contact.\nIf one or both of your parents weren\u2019t mature enough to give you emotional support, as a child you would have felt the effects of not having it,\nbut you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have known what was wrong. You might have\nthought that feeling empty and alone was your own private, strange experience, something that made you different from other people. As a child,\nyou had no way of knowing that this hollow feeling is a normal, universal\nresponse to lacking adequate human companionship. \u201cEmotional loneliness\u201d is a term that suggests its own cure: being on the receiving end of\nanother person\u2019s sympathetic interest in what you\u2019re feeling.

    "title": "How Children Cope with Emotional Loneliness",
    "text": "Emotional loneliness is so distressing that a child who experiences it will do whatever is necessary to make some kind of connection with the parent. These children may learn to put other people\u2019s needs first as the price of admission to a relationship. Instead of expecting others to provide support or show interest in them, they may take on the role of helping others, convincing everyone that they have few emotional needs of their own. Unfortunately, this tends to create even more loneliness, since covering up your deepest needs prevents genuine connection with others. Lacking adequate parental support or connection, many emotionally deprived children are eager to leave childhood behind. They perceive that the best solution is to grow up quickly and become self-sufficient. These children become competent beyond their years but lonely at their core. They often jump into adulthood prematurely, getting jobs as soon as they can, becoming sexually active, marrying early, or joining the service. It\u2019s as though they\u2019re saying, Since I\u2019m already taking care of myself, I might as well go ahead and get the benefits of growing up fast. They look forward to adulthood, believing it offers freedom and a chance to belong. Sadly, in their rush to leave home they may end up marrying the wrong person, tolerating exploitation, or staying with a job that takes more than it gives. They often settle for emotional loneliness in their relationships because it feels normal to them, like their early home life.",

The most primitive parts of our brain tell us that safety lies in familiarity (Bowlby 1979). We gravitate to situations we have had experience with because we know how to deal with them. As children, we don\u2019t recognize our parents\u2019 limitations, because seeing our parents as immature or flawed is frightening. Unfortunately, by denying the painful truth about our parents, we aren\u2019t able to recognize similarly hurtful people in future relationships. Denial makes us repeat the same situation over and over because we never see it coming the next time. Sophie\u2019s story illustrates this dynamic well. ",

    "text": "I have a special place in my heart for people like Sophie, who function so well that other people think they have no problems. In fact, their competence makes it hard for them to take their own pain seriously. \u201cI have it all,\u201d they\u2019re likely to say. \u201cI should be happy. Why do I feel so miserable?\u201d This is the classic confusion of a person whose physical needs were met in childhood while emotional needs remained unfulfilled. People like Sophie often feel guilty for complaining. Men and women alike will list the things they have to be thankful for, as if their life were an addition problem whose positive sum means nothing can be wrong. But they can\u2019t shake the feeling of being fundamentally alone and lacking the level of emotional intimacy they crave in their closest relationships. By the time they come to see me, some of them are either ready to leave their partner or are involved in an affair that gives them some of what they need. Others have avoided romantic relationships altogether, seeing emotional commitment as a trap they prefer to stay out of. Still others have decided to stay in their relationship for their children and come to therapy for help in learning how to be less angry and resentful. Few of these people walk into my office with the thought that their lack of satisfying emotional intimacy started in childhood. They are usually mystified as to how they ended up in a life that doesn\u2019t make them happy. They struggle with feelings of selfishness for wanting something more out of life. As Sophie initially said, \u201cRelationships are always going to have frustrations. It\u2019s work, right?\u201d She was partly right. Good relationships do take some effort and forbearance. But it shouldn\u2019t take work just to be noticed. Making an emotional connection ought to be the easy part.",

  "Emotional Loneliness Transcends Gender": {
    "title": "Emotional Loneliness Transcends Gender",
    "text": "Although women still outnumber men in seeking psychotherapy, I\u2019ve worked with many men who have faced the same issue of feeling lonely in their primary relationship. In some ways, it\u2019s even more poignant for them because our culture maintains that males have fewer emotional needs. But taking a look at the rates of suicide and violence reveals that this isn\u2019t true. Men are more likely to become violent or succeed at suicide when they feel emotionally anguished. Men who lack emotional intimacy, a sense of belonging, or caring attention can feel as empty as anybody else, though they may resist showing it. Emotional connection is a basic human need, regardless of gender. Children who feel they cannot engage their parents emotionally often try to strengthen their connection by playing whatever roles they believe their parents want them to. Although this may win them some fleeting approval, it doesn\u2019t yield genuine emotional closeness. Emotionally disconnected parents don\u2019t suddenly develop a capacity for empathy just because a child does something to please them. People who lacked emotional engagement in childhood, men and women alike, often can\u2019t believe that someone would want to have a relationship with them just because of who they are. They believe that if they want closeness, they must play a role that always puts the other person first.  Jake\u2019s Story Jake had recently married Kayla, a bubbly woman who made him feel genuinely loved. He was happy when he got married, but now he couldn\u2019t shake a feeling of being very down in the dumps. \u201cI should be happy,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest guy in the world, and I\u2019m trying hard to be the person she wants me to be. But I feel like I\u2019m acting, forcing myself to be more upbeat than I really am. I hate feeling like I\u2019m faking it.\u201d I asked Jake who he thought he should be with Kayla. \u201cI should be a person who is super happy, like she is. I need to make her feel loved and keep her happy. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d He looked at me expectantly for confirmation, but when I just waited, he went on: \u201cWhen she comes home from work, I try hard to act really happy and excited, but it\u2019s more than I\u2019m really feeling. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d I asked him what he thought would happen if he were to honestly tell Kayla about the strain he felt, and he said, \u201cShe would be devastated and furious if I tried to talk to her about it.\u201d I told Jake that I believed sharing his honest feelings might have enraged someone in his past, but it didn\u2019t sound like how Kayla would respond. It sounded more like what he had told me about his angry mother, who was quick to blow up if people didn\u2019t do what she wanted. Jake\u2019s secure relationship with Kayla was tempting him to relax and be himself, but he was sure that his relationship would suffer if he stopped trying so hard. When I told Jake that maybe this safe new relationship was giving him a chance to finally be loved for himself, he was uncomfortable with the reference to his emotional needs. He looked embarrassed and said, \u201cWhen you say it like that, I sound pitiful and needy.\u201d During childhood, Jake had gotten the message from his mother that showing any emotional needs meant he was weak. Further, if he didn\u2019t act how she wanted him to, he felt inadequate and unlovable. Jake was eventually able to understand his feelings and become more genuine with Kayla, who totally accepted him. But he was astounded by how much anger toward his mother we\u2019d unearthed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how much I hated her,\u201d he said. What Jake didn\u2019t realize is that hate is a normal and involuntary reaction when somebody tries to control you for no good reason. It signals that the person is extinguishing your emotional life force by getting his or her needs met at your expense.",

    "text": "Emotionally immature parents don\u2019t know how to validate their child\u2019s feelings and instincts. Without this validation, children learn to give in to what others seem sure about. As adults, they may deny their instincts to the point where they acquiesce to relationships they don\u2019t really want. They may then believe it\u2019s up to them to make the relationship work. They may rationalize why they have to try so hard in the relationship, as though it were normal to struggle daily to get along with your mate. While effort is needed to maintain communication and connection in a relationship, it shouldn\u2019t feel like constant, unrewarding work. The truth is, if both partners fit each other, understand each other\u2019s feelings, and are positive and supportive, relationships are primarily pleasurable, not arduous. It isn\u2019t asking too much to generally feel happy when you see your partner or look forward to time together. When people say, \u201cYou can\u2019t have everything,\u201d they\u2019re really saying they don\u2019t have what they need. As a human being, you can trust yourself to know when you\u2019re emotionally satisfied. You know when you\u2019ve been given full measure. You aren\u2019t a bottomless pits of ceaseless demands. You can trust the inner prompts that tell you when something is missing. But if you\u2019ve been trained to discount your feelings, you\u2019ll feel guilty for complaining if everything looks okay on the outside. If you have a place to live, a regular paycheck, enough food, and a partner or friends, conventional wisdom says, \u201cHow bad can it be?\u201d Many people can readily enumerate all the reasons why they should be satisfied and be shy about admitting that they aren\u2019t.

They lack confidence that others could be interested in them. Instead of asking for what they want, their low self-confidence makes them shy and conflicted about seeking attention. They\u2019re convinced they would be bothering others if they tried to make their needs known. Unfortunately, by expecting past rejection to repeat itself, these children end up stifling themselves and promoting more emotional loneliness. In this situation, people create their own emotional loneliness by hanging back instead of interacting. As a therapist, my job is to help them realize how their parents have damaged their self-confidence while also encouraging them to tolerate the anxiety of trying something new in order to connect more with others.

In this book, our mission is not to disrespect or betray your parents, but to finally see them objectively. I hope you\u2019ll see that the discussions of emotionally immature parents in this book are informed by a deep understanding of the reasons for their limitations. As you\u2019ll see, much of their immature, hurtful behavior is unintentional. By viewing these and other aspects of your parents more dispassionately, you can understand things about yourself and your history that you might not have thought about before. Most signs of emotional immaturity are beyond a person\u2019s conscious control, and most emotionally immature parents have no awareness of how they\u2019ve affected their children. We aren\u2019t trying to blame these parents, but to understand why they are the way they are. My hope is that any new insights about your parent you gain from reading this book will have the result of radically increasing your own self-awareness and emotional freedom. Fortunately, as adults, we have the ability and independence to assess whether our parents can really give us the care and understanding we desire. To judge this objectively, it\u2019s important to understand not just your parents\u2019 superficial behavioral characteristics, but also their underlying emotional framework. Once you understand these deeper traits and learn what to expect from your parents and how to label their behaviors, you\u2019re far less likely to be caught unaware by their limitations. Keep in mind that your thoughts about your parents are private. They may never know what you\u2019ve gotten from this book, nor do they need to. The goal is for you to gain the self-confidence that comes from knowing the truth of your own story. You aren\u2019t betraying your parents by seeing them accurately. Thinking about them objectively can\u2019t hurt them. But it can help you. As you saw in the previous chapter, emotionally immature parents can have devastating impacts on their children\u2019s self-esteem and relationships in adulthood. The effects can range from mild to severe, depending on the parent\u2019s level of immaturity, but the net effect is the same: the children feel emotionally unseen and lonely. This erodes their children\u2019s sense of their own lovability and can lead to excessive caution about emotional intimacy with others.",

Emotional maturity isn\u2019t a murky matter of opinion; it has been well and famously studied. \u201cEmotional maturity\u201d means a person is capable of thinking objectively and conceptually while sustaining deep emotional connections to others. People who are emotionally mature can function independently while also having deep emotional attachments, smoothly incorporating both into their daily life. They are direct about pursuing what they want, yet do so without exploiting other people. They\u2019ve differentiated from their original family relationships sufficiently to build a life of their own (Bowen 1978). They have a well-developed sense of self (Kohut 1985) and identity (Erikson 1963) and treasure their closest relationships. Emotionally mature people are comfortable and honest about their own feelings and get along well with other people, thanks to their welldeveloped empathy, impulse control, and emotional intelligence (Goleman 1995). They\u2019re interested in other people\u2019s inner lives and enjoy opening up and sharing with others in an emotionally intimate way. When there\u2019s a problem, they deal with others directly to smooth out differences (Bowen 1978). Emotionally mature people cope with stress in a realistic, forwardlooking way, while consciously processing their thoughts and feelings. They can control their emotions when necessary, anticipate the future, adapt to reality, and use empathy and humor to ease difficult situations and strengthen bonds with others (Vaillant 2000). They enjoy being objective and know themselves well enough to admit their weaknesses (Siebert 1996).",

Among emotionally immature people, however, the childhood instinct to do what feels good never really changes (Bowen 1978). They make decisions on the basis of what feels best in the moment and often follow the path of least resistance.

Anna convinced her brother, Tom, to come with her to talk to their elderly father about going into assisted living. After visiting with their father a bit, the time came to talk seriously. Suddenly, Tom was nowhere to be found. Anna searched the house and then looked out the front window in time to see her brother getting in his car and leaving. Anna was incredulous and wondered how Tom could run out like that. But when you realize that, in that moment, walking out of the house felt much better than staying for a difficult confrontation, it makes sense.",

  "They Have Low Empathy and Are Emotionally Insensitive": {
    "title": "They Have Low Empathy and Are Emotionally Insensitive",
    "text": "Impaired empathy is a central characteristic of emotionally immature people, as is avoidance of emotional sharing and intimacy. Being out of touch with their own deeper feelings, they\u2019re strikingly blind to how they make other people feel. Empathy isn\u2019t just a social nicety, like being tactful. It\u2019s a necessity for true emotional intimacy. You can\u2019t have a deep relationship without it. My favorite definition of empathy comes from infant attachment researchers Klaus and Karin Grossman and Anna Schwan, who described empathy as a sensitive mother\u2019s ability \u201cto see and to feel states and intentions from the baby\u2019s point of view\u201d (1986, 127). This definition includes being aware of both emotions and intentions. Beyond just sympathy, it entails correctly reading people\u2019s interests and how their will is being directed. The highest form of empathy requires an effort of imagination, which has been called mentalization (Fonagy and Target 2008), meaning the ability to imagine that other people have their own unique minds and thought processes. Developmental psychologists refer to this as having a theory of mind. Acquiring this ability is an important developmental milestone for children. Mentalizing allows you to grasp other people\u2019s viewpoints and overall inner experience because you realize they have a mind of their own, different from yours. Good parents are excellent at empathizing and mentalizing; their interest in their child\u2019s mind makes the child feel seen and understood. It\u2019s also an indispensable characteristic for leadership in business, the military, or any situation where understanding and predicting the motives of others is central. Empathy is a bedrock component of emotional intelligence (Goleman 1995), which is essential to social and occupational success. In his conversations with the Dalai Lama, psychologist Paul Ekman distinguished between different types of empathy and compassion. True empathy involves more than knowing what people feel; it also entails the ability to resonate with those feelings (Dalai Lama and Ekman 2008). For example, sociopaths may do an excellent job of reading a person\u2019s emotional vulnerabilities, but without the ability to resonate with the other person\u2019s feelings, knowledge of those feelings becomes a tool for predation, not connection. This casts light on a curious fact about emotionally immature people. In spite of not resonating empathically, they are often quite canny when it comes to reading other people\u2019s intentions and feelings. However, they don\u2019t use their understanding of people to foster emotional intimacy. Instead, their empathy operates at an instinctual or superficially sentimental level. You may feel sized up, but not felt for. Lack of resonant empathy suggests a lack of self-development. For parents to accurately imagine what their children are feeling, they need to have enough self-development to be aware of their own emotions. If they haven\u2019t developed their own emotional self-awareness, they can\u2019t resonate with how others, including their own children, might feel inside.",

    "text": "Many of my clients have shared stories that reflect the emotional immaturity of their parents. For me, this begs the question of what could have caused so much emotional underdevelopment in so many parents. Based on my observations and clinical experience, it seems likely that the parents of many of my clients were emotionally shut down as children. As my clients and I have explored their family histories, they\u2019ve often recalled evidence of great unhappiness and tension in their parents\u2019 early lives. Substance abuse, abandonment, loss, abuse, or traumatic immigration experiences hover in the family background, suggesting an atmosphere of loss, pain, and disconnection. Many people have told me that although they felt discounted or abused, it was nothing compared to the stories their parents told about their own childhood misery. Often the relationship between a client\u2019s mother and maternal grandmother was conflictual and unsatisfying, even though that grandmother might have become a nurturing figure for the client. It seems that many of my clients\u2019 parents never had a supportive or emotionally intimate connection with their own parents, so they developed tough defenses to survive their own emotional loneliness early in life. It\u2019s also important to remember that old-school parenting\u2014the upbringing my clients\u2019 parents experienced\u2014was very much about children being seen but not heard. Physical punishment was not only acceptable, it was condoned, even in schools, as the way to make children responsible. For many parents, \u201cspare the rod and spoil the child\u201d was considered conventional wisdom. They weren\u2019t concerned about children\u2019s feelings; they saw parenting as being about teaching children how to behave. It wasn\u2019t until 1946 that Dr. Benjamin Spock, in the original version of his megaseller The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care, widely popularized the idea that children\u2019s feelings and individuality were important factors to consider, in addition to physical care and discipline. In the generations before this shift, parenting tended to focus on obedience as the gold standard of children\u2019s development, rather than thinking about supporting children\u2019s emotional security and individuality.",

Because they had to bend to fit their families, they were unable to develop fluidly into the integrated, natural people they might have become. It may be that many emotionally immature people weren\u2019t allowed to explore and express their feelings and thoughts enough to develop a strong sense of self and a mature, individual identity. This made it hard for them to know themselves, limiting their ability to engage in emotional intimacy. If you don\u2019t have a basic sense of who you are as a person, you can\u2019t learn how to emotionally engage with other people at a deep level.

    "text": "Instead of having a well-integrated sense of who they are, emotionally immature people are more like an amalgam of various borrowed parts, many of which don\u2019t go together well. Because they had to shut down important parts of themselves out of fear of their parents\u2019 reactions, their personalities formed in isolated clumps, like pieces of a puzzle that don\u2019t fit together. This explains their inconsistent reactions, which make them so difficult to understand. Because they probably weren\u2019t allowed to express and integrate their emotional experiences in childhood, these people grow up to be emotionally inconsistent adults. Their personalities are weakly structured, and they often express contradictory emotions and behaviors. They step in and out of emotional states, never noticing their inconsistency. When they become parents, these traits create emotional bafflement in their children. One woman described her mother\u2019s behavior as chaotic, \u201cflip-flopping in ways that made no sense.\u201d This inconsistency means that, as parents, emotionally immature people may be either loving or detached, depending on their mood. Their children feel fleeting moments of connection with them but don\u2019t know when or under what conditions their parent might be emotionally available again. This sets up what behavioral psychologists call an intermittent reward situation, meaning that getting a reward for your efforts is possible but completely unpredictable. This creates a tenacious resolve to keep trying to get the reward, because once in a while these efforts do pay off. In this way, parental inconsistency can be the quality that binds children most closely to their parent, as they keep hoping to get that infrequent and elusive positive response. Growing up with an inconsistent parent is likely to undermine a child\u2019s sense of security, keeping the child on edge. Since a parent\u2019s response provides a child\u2019s emotional compass for self-worth, such children also are likely to believe that their parent\u2019s changing moods are somehow their fault.",

    "text": "Instead of learning about themselves and developing a strong, cohesive self in early childhood, emotionally immature people learned that certain feelings were bad and forbidden. They unconsciously developed defenses against experiencing many of their deeper feelings. As a result, energies that could have gone toward developing a full self were instead devoted to suppressing their natural instincts, resulting in a limited capacity for emotional intimacy. Not realizing the magnitude of their parents\u2019 developmental limitations, many children of emotionally immature people think there must be a genuine, fully developed person hiding inside the parent, a real self they could connect to if only their parent would let them. This is especially true if the parent was occasionally affectionate or attentive. As one woman told me, \u201cWith my parents, I used to pick the good part of them I liked and pretend that was the real part. I would tell myself that this good part would eventually win out, but it never did take over. I also used to pretend that the hurtful parts of them weren\u2019t real.

Whether they can ultimately become more authentic and emotionally available depends on their ability to self-reflect. People often wonder whether their parents can ever change. That depends on whether their parents are willing to self-reflect, which is the first step in any change.

    "text": "As children, many emotionally immature people grew up in homes where they were taught that the spontaneous expression of certain feelings was a shameful breach of family custom. They learned that expressing, or even experiencing, these deeper feelings could bring shame or punishment, resulting in what psychotherapy researcher Leigh McCullough and her colleagues have called affect phobia (McCullough et al. 2003). Having learned to link their most personal emotions with judgments about being bad, they could no longer stand to acknowledge certain feelings, especially those related to emotional intimacy. As a result, they anxiously sought to inhibit their genuine reactions, developing defensive behaviors instead of experiencing their true feelings and impulses (Ezriel 1952). Affect phobia can lead to an inflexible, narrow personality based on rigid defenses against certain feelings. As adults, these emotionally immature people have an automatic anxiety reaction when it comes to deep emotional connection. Most genuine emotion makes them feel exposed and extremely nervous. Throughout life, their energy has been devoted to creating a defensive facade that protects them from emotional vulnerability with other people. To avoid dangerous emotional intimacy, they stick to a well-worn life script and resist talking about or processing emotions, including in relationships. As parents, they pass down this fear of vulnerable emotions to their children. In such families, the saying \u201cI\u2019ll give you something to cry about\u201d is a common parental response to an upset child. Many children of emotionally phobic parents develop the fear that if they start crying, they\u2019ll never stop, which arises because they were never allowed to find out that crying naturally stops on its own when allowed its full expression. Because they grew up with emotionally phobic parents who stepped in to squelch their distress, they never experienced the natural rhythm of a crying episode and how it winds down. It\u2019s easy to see how children growing up under these conditions could become fearful of their own emotions. In fact, even positive feelings of joy and excitement can become associated with anxiety. For example, Anthony recalled a painful incident when he joyfully raced out the front door to greet his father as he pulled up in the driveway. Anthony leaped over a small bush, swiped it with his foot, and knocked it over. Instead of appreciating Anthony\u2019s display of affection, his father gave him a beating. As a result, Anthony learned not only to be afraid of his father, but to fear spontaneous joy as something that would get him in trouble.",

    "text": "In addition to emotional and behavioral differences, there are often intellectual differences between emotionally mature and immature people. If your parents grew up in a family atmosphere that was full of anxiety and judgment, they may have learned to think narrowly and resist complexity. Excessive childhood anxiety leads not only to emotional immaturity but also to oversimplified thinking that cannot hold opposing ideas in mind. Repressive or punitive family environments typically don\u2019t encourage free thinking or self-expression and therefore aren\u2019t conducive to fully developing one\u2019s mind.",

  "Difficulties with Conceptual Thinking": {
    "title": "Difficulties with Conceptual Thinking",
    "text": "Starting in adolescence, children begin to think conceptually, enabling them to solve problems with logic and reasoning instead of knee-jerk impulses. Accelerated brain development means they become both more objective and more imaginative. They can group ideas in categories and quickly think in symbols. They go beyond simply memorizing things and start to evaluate ideas, not just compare facts. They are able to think independently and hypothetically, and to generate new insights from previous knowledge. As children enter their teen years, their ability to self-reflect skyrockets because they become able to think about their own thinking (Piaget 1963). However, the intense emotions and anxiety that emotionally immature people experience can decrease their ability to think at this higher level. Since they are often at the mercy of their emotions, their higher thinking can easily fall apart under stress. In fact, their frequent lack of self-reflection comes from this tendency to regress and temporarily lose their ability to think about their thinking. When emotion-inducing topics come up, their minds fall into rigid black-or-white thinking that rejects complexity and precludes any cross-pollination of ideas. Emotionally immature people who are otherwise intelligent can think conceptually and show insight as long as they don\u2019t feel too threatened in the moment. Their intellectual objectivity is limited to topics that aren\u2019t emotionally arousing to them. This can be puzzling to their children, who experience two very different sides to their parents: sometimes intelligent and insightful, other times narrow-minded and impossible to reason with.",

For example, one man found his mother\u2019s phone conversations draining and boring because she never talked about anything substantive. Instead, she only asked him mundane questions, like what he was doing at the moment or what the weather was like.

In those areas, emotionally immature people can conceptualize well\u2014indeed, excessively. But they don\u2019t apply that ability to self-reflection or being emotionally sensitive toward others. Their preoccupation with ideas distracts them from emotional intimacy. They may discuss their favorite topics at length, but they don\u2019t really engage the other person.

It undermines people\u2019s ability to deal with stress and to be emotionally intimate with others. Emotionally immature people often grew up in a family environment that curtailed their full emotional and intellectual development. As a result, they have an oversimplified approach to life, narrowing situations down to fit their rigid coping skills. Having such a limited sense of self makes them egocentric and undermines their ability to be sensitive to other people\u2019s needs and feelings. Their reactive emotions, lack of objectivity, and fear of emotional intimacy can make close relationships difficult, especially when it comes to their children.

    "text": "If you\u2019re an internalizer, you may wonder how you ended up being so alert to other people\u2019s inner states. It could be that you were prompted to be so attuned to the feelings and needs of others by something as basic as your nervous system. Internalizers are extremely sensitive and, far more than most people, notice everything. They react to life as if they were an emotional tuning fork, picking up and resonating with vibrations from other people and the world around them. This perceptiveness can be both a blessing and a curse. As one client described it to me, \u201cMy brain absorbs everything! I can\u2019t believe how much stuff I pick up on, it seeps right into me.\u201d Internalizers may have an exceptionally alert nervous system from birth. Some research has found that differences in babies\u2019 levels of attunement to the environment can be seen at a very early age (Porges 2011). Even as five-month-old infants, some babies show more perceptiveness and sustained interest than others (Conradt, Measelle, and Ablow 2013). Further, these characteristics were found to be correlated with the kinds of behaviors children engaged in as they matured. In his review of his own and others\u2019 research, neuroscientist Stephen Porges (2011) has made a strong case that innate neurological differences exist even in newborns. His research suggests that, from early in life, people may differ widely in their ability to self-soothe and regulate physiological functions when under stress. To me, this seems to indicate the possibility that a predisposition to a certain coping style may exist from infancy.",

When internalizers experience a painful emotion, they\u2019re much more likely to look sad or cry\u2014just the sort of display an emotionally phobic parent can\u2019t stand. On the other hand, when externalizers have strong feelings, they act them out in behavior before they experience much internal distress. Therefore, other people are likely to see externalizers as having a behavior problem rather than an emotional issue, even though emotions are causing the behavior. Emotionally immature parents may yell at or punish externalizers for their behavior, whereas they\u2019re more likely to dismiss or reject internalizers\u2019 feelings with shaming, contempt, or derision.

    "text": "Because they\u2019re so attuned to feelings, internalizers are extremely sensitive to the quality of emotional intimacy in their relationships. Their entire personality longs for emotional spontaneity and intimacy, and they can\u2019t be satisfied with less. Therefore, when they\u2019re raised by immature and emotionally phobic parents, they feel painfully lonely. If there\u2019s anything internalizers have in common, it\u2019s their need to share their inner experience. As children, their need for genuine emotional connection is the central fact of their existence. Nothing hurts their spirit more than being around someone who won\u2019t engage with them emotionally. A blank face kills something in them. They read people closely, looking for signs that they\u2019ve made a connection. This isn\u2019t a social urge, like wanting people to chat with; it\u2019s a powerful hunger to connect heart to heart with a like-minded person who can understand them. They find nothing more exhilarating than clicking with someone who gets them. When they can\u2019t make that kind of connection, they feel emotional loneliness. From chapter 4, you may recall that this need for emotional responsiveness and reciprocal interaction from the parent is normal in securely attached babies. It\u2019s how parent-child bonding takes place. Research has demonstrated that securely attached babies demonstrate distress and break down if their mothers stop responding to them and show only an expressionless face (Tronick, Adamson, and Brazelton 1975).

    "text": "Due to their perceptiveness and strong needs for social engagement, children who are internalizers are usually adept at finding potential sources of emotional connection outside the family. They notice when people respond to them warmly, and they naturally seek out relationships with safe people outside the family to gain an increased sense of security. Many of my clients have warm memories of a neighbor, relative, or teacher who made a huge difference in helping them feel valued and attended to. Others found similar support from pets or childhood buddies. Internalizers may even feel emotionally nurtured as they resonate with the beauty of nature or art. Spirituality can also provide this emotional nurturance, as internalizers experience and relate to a greater presence that accompanies them no matter what. Externalizers also have needs for emotional comforting, but they tend to force such needs on other people, taking others emotionally hostage with their reactivity. They often use their behavior to coerce certain responses from other people, but because they achieve these responses through manipulation, the attention they receive is never as satisfying as a free and genuine exchange of emotional intimacy. Externalizers also demand attention by blaming or guilt-tripping others. As a result, people may end up feeling that they have to help, whether they want to or not, creating resentment over the long run.",

When they feel insecure, instead of seeking comfort from other people they tend to feel threatened and launch into fight, flight, or freeze behaviors. They react to anxious moments in relationships with rigid, defensive behaviors that alienate other people, rather than bringing them closer. Anger, blame, criticism, and domination are all signs of poorly functioning skills in seeking comfort. Externalizers simply don\u2019t know how to reach out for soothing. Externalizers who get very upset may look like they have a strong drive toward emotional engagement, but their approach is more like panicking than connecting. It takes a lot to calm them, and even then they still seem vaguely mistrustful and dissatisfied because they aren\u2019t open to connecting fully.
