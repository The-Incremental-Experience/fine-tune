    "text": "Emotional loneliness comes from not having enough emotional\nintimacy with other people. It can start in childhood, due to\nfeeling emotionally unseen by self-preoccupied parents, or it can\narise in adulthood when an emotional connection is lost. If it\u2019s been a\nlifelong feeling, it points to the likelihood of not being sufficiently emotionally responded to as a child.\nGrowing up in a family with emotionally immature parents is a lonely\nexperience. These parents may look and act perfectly normal, caring for\ntheir child\u2019s physical health and providing meals and safety. However, if\nthey don\u2019t make a solid emotional connection with their child, the child\nwill have a gaping hole where true security might have been.\nThe loneliness of feeling unseen by others is as fundamental a pain as\nphysical injury, but it doesn\u2019t show on the outside. Emotional loneliness is\na vague and private experience, not easy to see or describe. You might call\nit a feeling of emptiness or being alone in the world. Some people have\ncalled this feeling existential loneliness, but there\u2019s nothing existential\nabout it. If you feel it, it came from your family.\nChildren have no way of identifying a lack of emotional intimacy in\ntheir relationship with a parent. It isn\u2019t a concept they have. And it\u2019s even \nless likely that they can understand that their parents are emotionally\nimmature. All they have is a gut feeling of emptiness, which is how a child\nexperiences loneliness. With a mature parent, the child\u2019s remedy for loneliness is simply to go to the parent for affectionate connection. But if your\nparent was scared of deep feelings, you might have been left with an uneasy\nsense of shame for needing comforting.\nWhen the children of emotionally immature parents grow up, the\ncore emptiness remains, even if they have a superficially normal adult life.\nTheir loneliness can continue into adulthood if they unwittingly choose\nrelationships that can\u2019t give them enough emotional connection. They\nmay go to school, work, marry, and raise children, but all the while they\u2019ll\nstill be haunted by that core sense of emotional isolation. In this chapter,\nwe\u2019ll look at people\u2019s experience of emotional loneliness, along with how\nself-awareness helped them understand what they were missing and how\nto change.",

    "text": "Emotional intimacy involves knowing that you have someone you can tell\nanything to, someone to go to with all your feelings, about anything and\neverything. You feel completely safe opening up to the other person,\nwhether in the form of words, through an exchange of looks, or by just\nbeing together quietly in a state of connection. Emotional intimacy is profoundly fulfilling, creating a sense of being seen for who you really are. It\ncan only exist when the other person seeks to know you, not judge you.\nAs children, the basis for our security is emotional connection with\nour caretakers. Emotionally engaged parents make children feel that they\nalways have someone to go to. This kind of security requires genuine emotional interactions with parents. Parents who are emotionally mature\nengage in this level of emotional connection almost all the time. They\u2019ve\ndeveloped enough self-awareness to be comfortable with their own feelings, as well as those of other people.\nMore importantly, they\u2019re emotionally attuned to their children,\nnoticing their children\u2019s moods and welcoming their feelings with interest.\nA child feels safe connecting with such a parent, whether seeking comfort\nor sharing enthusiasm. Mature parents make their children feel that they\nenjoy engaging with them and that it\u2019s fine to talk about emotional issues.\nThese parents have a lively, balanced emotional life and are usually consistent in their attentiveness and interest toward their children. They are\nemotionally dependable.",

    "text": "Parents who are emotionally immature, on the other hand, are so selfpreoccupied that they don\u2019t notice their children\u2019s inner experiences. In\naddition, they discount feelings, and they fear emotional intimacy. They\u2019re\nuncomfortable with their own emotional needs and therefore have no idea\nhow to offer support at an emotional level. Such parents may even become\nnervous and angry if their children get upset, punishing them instead of\ncomforting them. These reactions shut down children\u2019s instinctive urge to\nreach out, closing the door to emotional contact.\nIf one or both of your parents weren\u2019t mature enough to give you emotional support, as a child you would have felt the effects of not having it,\nbut you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have known what was wrong. You might have\nthought that feeling empty and alone was your own private, strange experience, something that made you different from other people. As a child,\nyou had no way of knowing that this hollow feeling is a normal, universal\nresponse to lacking adequate human companionship. \u201cEmotional loneliness\u201d is a term that suggests its own cure: being on the receiving end of\nanother person\u2019s sympathetic interest in what you\u2019re feeling. This type of\nloneliness isn\u2019t an odd or senseless feeling; it\u2019s the predictable result of\ngrowing up without sufficient empathy from others.\nTo round out this description of emotional loneliness, let\u2019s look at two\npeople who vividly remember this feeling from childhood and describe it\nwell.",

    "title": "How Children Cope with Emotional Loneliness",
    "text": "Emotional loneliness is so distressing that a child who experiences it will do whatever is necessary to make some kind of connection with the parent. These children may learn to put other people\u2019s needs first as the price of admission to a relationship. Instead of expecting others to provide support or show interest in them, they may take on the role of helping others, convincing everyone that they have few emotional needs of their own. Unfortunately, this tends to create even more loneliness, since covering up your deepest needs prevents genuine connection with others. Lacking adequate parental support or connection, many emotionally deprived children are eager to leave childhood behind. They perceive that the best solution is to grow up quickly and become self-sufficient. These children become competent beyond their years but lonely at their core. They often jump into adulthood prematurely, getting jobs as soon as they can, becoming sexually active, marrying early, or joining the service. It\u2019s as though they\u2019re saying, Since I\u2019m already taking care of myself, I might as well go ahead and get the benefits of growing up fast. They look forward to adulthood, believing it offers freedom and a chance to belong. Sadly, in their rush to leave home they may end up marrying the wrong person, tolerating exploitation, or staying with a job that takes more than it gives. They often settle for emotional loneliness in their relationships because it feels normal to them, like their early home life.",

    "title": "Why the Past Repeats Itself?",
    "text": "If the lack of emotional connection with emotionally immature parents is so painful, why do so many people end up in similarly frustrating relationships in adulthood? The most primitive parts of our brain tell us that safety lies in familiarity (Bowlby 1979). We gravitate to situations we have had experience with because we know how to deal with them. As children, we don\u2019t recognize our parents\u2019 limitations, because seeing our parents as immature or flawed is frightening. Unfortunately, by denying the painful truth about our parents, we aren\u2019t able to recognize similarly hurtful people in future relationships. Denial makes us repeat the same situation over and over because we never see it coming the next time. Sophie\u2019s story illustrates this dynamic well. ",

    "text": "I have a special place in my heart for people like Sophie, who function so well that other people think they have no problems. In fact, their competence makes it hard for them to take their own pain seriously. \u201cI have it all,\u201d they\u2019re likely to say. \u201cI should be happy. Why do I feel so miserable?\u201d This is the classic confusion of a person whose physical needs were met in childhood while emotional needs remained unfulfilled. People like Sophie often feel guilty for complaining. Men and women alike will list the things they have to be thankful for, as if their life were an addition problem whose positive sum means nothing can be wrong. But they can\u2019t shake the feeling of being fundamentally alone and lacking the level of emotional intimacy they crave in their closest relationships. By the time they come to see me, some of them are either ready to leave their partner or are involved in an affair that gives them some of what they need. Others have avoided romantic relationships altogether, seeing emotional commitment as a trap they prefer to stay out of. Still others have decided to stay in their relationship for their children and come to therapy for help in learning how to be less angry and resentful. Few of these people walk into my office with the thought that their lack of satisfying emotional intimacy started in childhood. They are usually mystified as to how they ended up in a life that doesn\u2019t make them happy. They struggle with feelings of selfishness for wanting something more out of life. As Sophie initially said, \u201cRelationships are always going to have frustrations. It\u2019s work, right?\u201d She was partly right. Good relationships do take some effort and forbearance. But it shouldn\u2019t take work just to be noticed. Making an emotional connection ought to be the easy part.",

    "title": "Emotional Loneliness Transcends Gender",
    "text": "Although women still outnumber men in seeking psychotherapy, I\u2019ve worked with many men who have faced the same issue of feeling lonely in their primary relationship. In some ways, it\u2019s even more poignant for them because our culture maintains that males have fewer emotional needs. But taking a look at the rates of suicide and violence reveals that this isn\u2019t true. Men are more likely to become violent or succeed at suicide when they feel emotionally anguished. Men who lack emotional intimacy, a sense of belonging, or caring attention can feel as empty as anybody else, though they may resist showing it. Emotional connection is a basic human need, regardless of gender. Children who feel they cannot engage their parents emotionally often try to strengthen their connection by playing whatever roles they believe their parents want them to. Although this may win them some fleeting approval, it doesn\u2019t yield genuine emotional closeness. Emotionally disconnected parents don\u2019t suddenly develop a capacity for empathy just because a child does something to please them. People who lacked emotional engagement in childhood, men and women alike, often can\u2019t believe that someone would want to have a relationship with them just because of who they are. They believe that if they want closeness, they must play a role that always puts the other person first.  Jake\u2019s Story Jake had recently married Kayla, a bubbly woman who made him feel genuinely loved. He was happy when he got married, but now he couldn\u2019t shake a feeling of being very down in the dumps. \u201cI should be happy,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest guy in the world, and I\u2019m trying hard to be the person she wants me to be. But I feel like I\u2019m acting, forcing myself to be more upbeat than I really am. I hate feeling like I\u2019m faking it.\u201d I asked Jake who he thought he should be with Kayla. \u201cI should be a person who is super happy, like she is. I need to make her feel loved and keep her happy. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d He looked at me expectantly for confirmation, but when I just waited, he went on: \u201cWhen she comes home from work, I try hard to act really happy and excited, but it\u2019s more than I\u2019m really feeling. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d I asked him what he thought would happen if he were to honestly tell Kayla about the strain he felt, and he said, \u201cShe would be devastated and furious if I tried to talk to her about it.\u201d I told Jake that I believed sharing his honest feelings might have enraged someone in his past, but it didn\u2019t sound like how Kayla would respond. It sounded more like what he had told me about his angry mother, who was quick to blow up if people didn\u2019t do what she wanted. Jake\u2019s secure relationship with Kayla was tempting him to relax and be himself, but he was sure that his relationship would suffer if he stopped trying so hard. When I told Jake that maybe this safe new relationship was giving him a chance to finally be loved for himself, he was uncomfortable with the reference to his emotional needs. He looked embarrassed and said, \u201cWhen you say it like that, I sound pitiful and needy.\u201d During childhood, Jake had gotten the message from his mother that showing any emotional needs meant he was weak. Further, if he didn\u2019t act how she wanted him to, he felt inadequate and unlovable. Jake was eventually able to understand his feelings and become more genuine with Kayla, who totally accepted him. But he was astounded by how much anger toward his mother we\u2019d unearthed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how much I hated her,\u201d he said. What Jake didn\u2019t realize is that hate is a normal and involuntary reaction when somebody tries to control you for no good reason. It signals that the person is extinguishing your emotional life force by getting his or her needs met at your expense.",

    "title": "Not Trusting Your Instincts",
    "text": "Emotionally immature parents don\u2019t know how to validate their child\u2019s feelings and instincts. Without this validation, children learn to give in to what others seem sure about. As adults, they may deny their instincts to the point where they acquiesce to relationships they don\u2019t really want. They may then believe it\u2019s up to them to make the relationship work. They may rationalize why they have to try so hard in the relationship, as though it were normal to struggle daily to get along with your mate. While effort is needed to maintain communication and connection in a relationship, it shouldn\u2019t feel like constant, unrewarding work. The truth is, if both partners fit each other, understand each other\u2019s feelings, and are positive and supportive, relationships are primarily pleasurable, not arduous. It isn\u2019t asking too much to generally feel happy when you see your partner or look forward to time together. When people say, \u201cYou can\u2019t have everything,\u201d they\u2019re really saying they don\u2019t have what they need. As a human being, you can trust yourself to know when you\u2019re emotionally satisfied. You know when you\u2019ve been given full measure. You aren\u2019t a bottomless pits of ceaseless demands. You can trust the inner prompts that tell you when something is missing. But if you\u2019ve been trained to discount your feelings, you\u2019ll feel guilty for complaining if everything looks okay on the outside. If you have a place to live, a regular paycheck, enough food, and a partner or friends, conventional wisdom says, \u201cHow bad can it be?\u201d Many people can readily enumerate all the reasons why they should be satisfied and be shy about admitting that they aren\u2019t. They blame themselves for not having the \u201cright\u201d feelings.",
